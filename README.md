# Boggle Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Boggle game. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library, along with a back-end model that handles the game logic.

## Features
- **Random Board Generation:** Every new game generates a unique set of tiles.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the words found and calculate scores based on word length.
- **Interactive GUI:** The GUI, developed with the Tkinter library, enhances user interaction, making the game more engaging and visually appealing.

## Prerequisites
To run the game, you will need Python installed on your system, as well as the Tkinter library, which is typically included with the standard Python installation. If not, you can install it via your package manager or check [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for more details.

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yinonkedem/Boggle.git cd Boggle

## How to Run the Game
